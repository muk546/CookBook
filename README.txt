How: 
-I have a login and registration screen where users create their accounts 
-There will be a recipe of the day at the welcome screen, this will chose a random recipe by its Unique ID number in my database. 
-The user enters the recipe data and add text, photos, etc
-Then the user can save the recipe and it will save to the database and will be visible under their my recipes tab
-The user can also share a PDF version by email and later ill implement cloud services.
